# Overview
QuestMarker is a simple, top-down game where you go on fetch quests for objects that all look the same. You can use WASD or the arrow keys
to move. From there, all you need to know is to follow the quest marker.

While learning how to use arcade with python, I knew I could never make a grand open-world RPG, but I could make a minimalist parody of 
a grand open-world RPG. The game is one fatch quest after another, with cringy referencial humor, and an arrow telling you where to go at
all times. Needless to say, creating this game was a lot of fun.
